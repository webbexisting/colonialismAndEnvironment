            <p>Climate Change isn't arriving, it's <i> here</i>.</p>
            <p>We all know it, we all feel it: the snowfall is never as heavy anymore, heatwaves are unbearable, and we hear of more and more spontaneous fires every year.</p>
            <p>But is that all?</p>
            <p>Because if we can feel the effects of climate change in the UK, what is it like for other countries? The ones we <i>don't</i> think about? Do they have it worse, and why do we not think about them?</p> 
            <p>And, lastly: <i>who</i> made it this way?</p>
            <p>Welcome to Colonialism and the Environment! Take our quiz below to find out why the planet is <i>really</i> burning, then explore the rest of our website to learn how to deal with the answer!</p>
